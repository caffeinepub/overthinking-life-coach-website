  "summary": "The diff implements a comprehensive single-page React coaching website covering nearly all specified requirements. All six sections (Hero, About, Services, Testimonials, FAQ, Contact) are present with appropriate content, saffron theming, SEO metadata, responsive navbar, and footer. The implementation is thorough and well-aligned with the build request. Minor gaps exist around the service icons image asset usage.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "requirement": "Each service card should use the generated minimalist saffron and indigo abstract icon set image (service-icons.dim_512x512.png) for icons",
      "reason": "The Services component uses Lucide React icons (User, Users, Building2) rather than the specified generated image asset service-icons.dim_512x512.png that was explicitly requested in the images section.",
