**Goal:** Build a single-page, SEO-optimized React website for a Bangalore-based Life Coach specializing in Overthinking, targeting mid-career professionals.

**Planned changes:**

- Hero section: full-viewport, bold headline targeting overthinking professionals, subheadline, saffron CTA button, trust indicator mentioning Bangalore, hero background image
- About section: coach photo placeholder, personal bio narrative, credential highlights, secondary saffron CTA
- Services section: 3 service cards (1:1 Coaching, Group Program, Corporate Workshop) each with icon, title, description, and saffron CTA; subtle blue-to-indigo gradient section background
- Testimonials section: 3 placeholder client testimonial cards with name, role, quote, and star rating; green-to-indigo gradient accent
- FAQ section: accordion with at least 5 questions relevant to overthinking coaching and Bangalore context
- Contact/CTA section: prominent headline, saffron "Book a Free Discovery Call" button, contact form (Name, Email, Phone, Message) with basic validation and frontend-only success message, Bangalore location mention
- Footer: brand name, tagline, section quick links, LinkedIn and Instagram placeholder icons, copyright, Bangalore location
- Visual theme: saffron (#F4A724) for all CTA buttons and key accents, warm off-white/cream backgrounds, dark charcoal text, serif headings, clean sans-serif body, blue/green/indigo gradients used sparingly in 2–3 sections
- SEO: keyword-rich `<title>` and `<meta description>`, Open Graph tags, semantic HTML5 landmarks, correct heading hierarchy (H1/H2/H3), JSON-LD LocalBusiness structured data for Bangalore, descriptive image alt attributes, canonical link tag

**User-visible outcome:** A polished, fully responsive single-page coaching website with warm professional design, all six content sections, SEO metadata, and a working frontend contact form — ready to use as a draft site.
